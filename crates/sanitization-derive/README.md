# sanitization-derive

Optional derive macros for the `sanitization` crate.

Use through the main crate:

```toml
sanitization = { version = "2.1.0", features = ["derive"] }
```

The derive crate only generates calls to traits from `sanitization`; it does
not implement memory wiping, comparison, or selection logic itself.

The runtime crate exact-pins this proc-macro crate to the same release. The
macros generate references to runtime traits, so independently mixing an older
runtime with a newer derive crate is unsupported and intentionally prevented by
Cargo resolution.

Available derives:

- `SecureSanitize`
- `SecureSanitizeOnDrop`
- `ConstantTimeEq`
- `ConditionallySelectable`

`ConstantTimeEq` and `ConditionallySelectable` are conservative field-wise
derives for structs. They never compare raw struct bytes, so they do not read
padding or representation details.

```rust
use sanitization::ct::{ConditionallySelectable as _, ConstantTimeEq as _};
use sanitization::{ConditionallySelectable, ConstantTimeEq};

#[derive(ConstantTimeEq, ConditionallySelectable)]
struct Tag {
    left: [u8; 16],
    right: [u8; 16],
}
```

`#[sanitization(skip, reason = "...")]` is supported for `SecureSanitize` and
`ConstantTimeEq` when a field is public or intentionally ignored. The reason
must be non-empty. Skips are rejected for `ConditionallySelectable` because
constructing the selected output requires every field.

## Enums

All derives reject enums. Safe generated code can reach only the active variant
and cannot clear bytes retained from a previously active, larger variant. Use a
struct with stable secret storage and an explicit public state tag. A reviewed
manual enum implementation must call
`sanitization::secure_replace(&mut value, replacement)` before every transition.

Duplicate, malformed, empty, and misplaced helper options are rejected.
`reason` is valid only together with `skip`. Enums and unions are rejected.

## Generic `SecureSanitizeOnDrop`

For structs with type parameters that hold sanitizable data, put the
`SecureSanitize + Unpin` bounds on the struct declaration:

```rust
use sanitization::{SecureSanitize, SecureSanitizeOnDrop};

#[derive(SecureSanitize, SecureSanitizeOnDrop)]
struct Wrapper<T: SecureSanitize + Unpin> {
    inner: T,
}
```

The generated `Drop` impl cannot add a stricter bound than the struct itself.
It requires the complete struct to be `Unpin` because a destructor may receive
a logically pinned value. It also requires `DropSafeSanitize` and invokes the
complete `SecureSanitize` implementation so reviewed aggregate cleanup is not
lost. `#[derive(SecureSanitize)]` supplies the marker for its generated
field-wise implementation. A manual aggregate sanitizer must implement
`DropSafeSanitize` explicitly after review; recursive self-replacement remains
a contract violation.
